## Project Overview

This project improves data quality and predictive modeling by combining robust outlier handling techniques and geospatial analysis. It detects and removes anomalies in the data and leverages spatial features such as coordinates and regional patterns to enhance model accuracy and extract meaningful insights.

## Features

- Data preprocessing including outlier detection and removal  
- Geospatial data analysis with visualization (maps, heatmaps)  
- Integration of geospatial features into machine learning models  
- Model training, validation, and evaluation
